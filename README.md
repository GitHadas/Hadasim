in the first exercise twitterTowers you need to open the src file in netbeans and run it in the green triangle.
in the second exercise you need to download the server folder and open it in visual studio code, 
and than right click on the server file and choose open in integrated terminal,
than for downloading all the dependencies write in the terminal "npm i",
and than run the server by writing in the terminal "node server.js",
for the second part of the exercise it is a simple word file.
hope its clear.
thank you.
